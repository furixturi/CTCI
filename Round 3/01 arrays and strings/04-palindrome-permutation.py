# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if
# it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or
# phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a
# rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited
# to just dictionary words.
