# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if 
# it is a permutation of a palinÂ­drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase 
# that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement 
# of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
